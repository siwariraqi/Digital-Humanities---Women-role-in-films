# Digital Humanities- Women's role in films

The Project’s Goal- 
The goal of the project is to examine the degree of involvement and integration of women in the movie industry. In more detail: 

-	The total number of female actors that participate in movies each year.
-	The total number of female actors that participate in movies by country.
-	The amount of time female actors appears in a movie in relation to the total time of that movie.
-	The change in the role of women in movies over the years by different criteria (such as movie genres, country of movie production, etc..). 

In other words, the project aims to collect data and information about women in the film industry, analyzing the information and presenting the findings.
The project will focus on all the films documented on TMDB that were released between certain years.

Our Research Question-
Our research question is primarily: was there an increase in the degree of involvement and integration of women in the film industry over the years?

The Project’s Background- 
In this section we will explain the context of our project in the world of digital humanities, emphasizing the social struggle. 
This project combines data mining from excessive and varied information sources, information analysis, and lastly retrieval of relevant information for the needs of the project. After collecting the data, we plan to draw conclusions and cross-reference information, in which will present the results in a graphical way. These findings will provide rich knowledge in an easy, clear, and straightforward way. We aim to make it reader friendly. 

The social struggle that our project deals with combines several points:
- Is there an increase / decrease in the number of women participating in movies?
- Does a director tend to involve women in movies? Has this changed as the world progressed?
- Does one see a woman as having a significant role (responsibility, profession, character ...)?

The Work Plan 
In this part of the proposal, we will discuss what tools are being considered for use.
- Initially, we plan to use several records from TMDB. This database is a movie database in which is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows.
- Secondly, after examining the movie records in the database and noting records which do not refer to gender (male/female), we will use Wikidata's API in order to help us find this gender partition (male vs. female). 
-Pursuing this further, we plan to get all films between certain years and the cast of the film, looking at all actors who played some type of role. Using SPARQL queries, we plan to cross-reference the information from TMDB and Wikidata to identify women (female actors). 
- To help us achieve the above we will create a Python script of type male and female. Then we will make an Excel file which contains all the years between the timeline we are focusing on, and the number of movies in which women participate in during those years.
- We will process the information we collected in the form of graphs to understand and analyze the data more easily. We will create this visual content using information we will save in the form of JSON files.
Using these tools, we will examine what roles women actors tend to play and their contribution to the movie. 

The Project’s Product
The product of our project will be a clear and reader-friendly display of our findings and results on a website.
For all our detailed queries mentioned above, we aim to map the gathered information into a series of graphs, timelines, diagrams, tables, and maps. 
Overall, this tool will allow one to explore the differences between male and female actors in significance of their roles. It will show the number of women in films in general and the amount of time women appeared in the films, all by different criteria such as date, country genre and more. This data eventually emphasizes the different view of men and women in general, and the shift over the years (if exists one), in respect to the film industry.

Visualization (graphs, timelines, etc.):
- Total number of actresses participating in films each year.
- Percentage of actresses who participate in movies out of all actors each year.
- Number of actresses participating in films categorized by country.
- Total time actresses appear in the film from the total time of the film, by year.
- Total time actresses appear in the film compared to actors, by year.
- The role of women in films over the years, categorized by genres (history, suspense, romance, etc.)
- The role women tend to play and the number of actresses who received role awards by years.
- Top 10 actresses by number of movies.
